<br>Chronic wounds<br/> represent a significant <br>health<br/> and <br>economic<br/> <br>burden<br/> worldwide. Effective treatments <br>require<br/> wound clinical <br>measurements<br/>, typically <br>performed manually<br/> by specialized healthcare professionals.

Wound surface area is typically measured by performing <br>planimetry<br/> of the wound bed. These procedures are not only <br>invasive<br/> and cause patient <br>discomfort<br/> but are also prone to errors due to <br>ambiguous<br/> definitions of metrics and variations in professionalsâ€™ skill levels.

Most <br>existing<br/> automatic commercial <br>approaches<br/> compute wound measurements solely from <br>2D images<br/>, which are perspective-dependent.
<!-- put image -->

<br>3D analysis<br/> of wounds allows for the computation of <br>richer wound biomarkers<br/>. However, studies in this direction only considered previous generation 3D reconstruction frameworks, which have recently been surpassed by highly optimized photogrammetric toolboxes and recent neural rendering alternatives, we are talking about <br>NeRF<br/> and <br>Gaussian Splatting<br/>!
<!-- put image? -->

<br>We introduce<br/> a new dataset <br>SALVE<br/>, designed to capture common challenges encountered in clinical settings. 
<!-- put image -->

<br>We evaluate<br/> robust <br>photogrammetry pipelines<br/> such as COLMAP and Meshroom and <br>modern neural rendering approaches for 3D reconstruction<br/> such as <br>NeRF<br/> and <br>Gaussian Splatting<br/>. 
<!-- put image -->

We follow a <br>rigorous evaluation protocol<br/> that defines metrics and procedures to assess the <br>geometric accuracy and precision<br/> of the evaluated reconstruction algorithms.
