## Introduction & Motivation
<b>Chronic wounds</b> represent a significant <b>health</b> and <b>economic</b> <b>burden</b> worldwide. Effective treatments <b>require</b> wound clinical <b>measurements</b>, typically <b>performed manually</b> by specialized healthcare professionals.

Wound surface area is typically measured by performing <b>planimetry</b> of the wound bed. These procedures are not only <b>invasive</b> and cause patient <b>discomfort</b> but are also prone to errors due to <b>ambiguous</b> definitions of metrics and variations in professionalsâ€™ skill levels.
<!-- Put image -->

Most <b>existing</b> automatic commercial <b>approaches</b> compute wound measurements solely from <b>2D images</b>, which are perspective-dependent.
<!-- put image -->

<b>3D analysis</b> of wounds allows for the computation of <b>richer wound biomarkers</b>. However, studies in this direction only considered previous generation 3D reconstruction frameworks, which have recently been surpassed by highly optimized photogrammetric toolboxes and recent neural rendering alternatives, we are talking about <b>NeRF</b> and <b>Gaussian Splatting</b>!
<!-- put image? -->

<b>We introduce</b> a new dataset <b>SALVE</b>, designed to capture common challenges encountered in clinical settings. 
<!-- put image -->

## Evaluation
<b>We evaluate</b> robust <b>photogrammetry pipelines</b> such as COLMAP and Meshroom and <b>modern neural rendering approaches for 3D reconstruction</b> such as <b>NeRF</b> and <b>Gaussian Splatting</b>. 
<!-- put image -->

We follow a <b>rigorous evaluation protocol</b> that defines metrics and procedures to assess the <b>geometric accuracy and precision</b> of the evaluated reconstruction algorithms.
